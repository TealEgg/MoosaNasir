In the image above, we start with a box and each iteration we divide the area of the box from the previous iteration by 4 and line it around the box.

The equation of area of the box each iteration is

where n starts at zero

The equation of the number of boxes each iteration is

where n starts at zero. The only difference is that in the square f(0) is equal to zero instead of one

The equation of the total area of the boxes of that iteration is

where n starts at zero. The only difference is that in the square t(0) is equal to zero instead of one
