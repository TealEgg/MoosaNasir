<b>Non-tessellating Regular Polygonal Grids</b>
Nov 16th 2022

The idea I had for this paper came before the idea for my last paper. Its a unique idea that I don't think anyone has done yet Its about non-tesselating grids, how to traverse them, how to plot the traversals, etc. While this paper is not editted much, it outlines the ideas. Below I will post a download link if you would like to see it.
