<b>Fractal</b>
June 24th 2022

A fractal I thought of
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TealEgg/Testing/main/TestDraw.png" alt="fractal">
This fractal can be infinitly zoomed, but it doesn't change and looks the same.

The pseudo equation of this fractal is

The squarish look of the fractal might just be due to the precision of the types I used while making this

Edit Sept 6th 2022 - Looking back, the squarish look couldn't come from the precision of the type. The image of this fractal is precisely accurate.
