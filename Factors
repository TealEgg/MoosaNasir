Greatest factors, smallest factor and some Prime as well
May 24th 2022

This is my first post so welcome! I just finished working on creating this website from scratch and it so far it works, but I kept running into issues. With that aside, in this post I'm going to be talking about the integer sequences of the largest, smallest, largest prime, and smallest prime facctor of each number. The sequences by the looks of it havn't been written so I just wanted to share them.
